# Welcome!


Hello awesome human being(or..alien?) and thank you for taking the time to view my repos!
As you can see, most of my projects are coming from my classes here at SAIT.
Thatâ€™s because I am still a student and I am learning lots of things! I am loving this course so far and there are so many things I want to learn. I will be coming back to clean up my code after this program and see what else I can do to make my projects better.


### The Project

This project showcases some of my favorite quotes from my favorite authors/individuals.
I also wanted to experiment with event listeners.

###### My Solution + Process
I wanted to include the author images to add to the visual and make it more interesting.
The focus is definitely on the images but I want you to look at the bright yellow first and then move to the image. The type does not take too much attention because I want the quotes to mean something to individuals and not put the meaning myself.

###### Tools + Techniques

```
* Vanilla JS
* Tweeter API
* SVG
```
### In conclusion

As this is a WIP, I would like to give it more life by adding animations when the quotes change. 
This was a great project as I was able to incorporte my design background!

I would also like to make it responsive!
